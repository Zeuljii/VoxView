{"name":"Voxview","tagline":"Javascript tool for 3D visualization of Landmark-style voxel geometry","body":"# Project Summary\r\n\r\nVoxView is a web-based tool for visualizing and manipulating\r\nLandmark-style voxel geometry. It is built upon several libraries:\r\n\r\n* [three.js](http://threejs.org/) for 3D WebGL/Canvas drawing\r\n* [dat.GUI](https://code.google.com/p/dat-gui/) for UI widgets\r\n* Detector.js and Orbit Controls.js from [Three.js Examples](https://github.com/stemkoski/stemkoski.github.com) (WebGL detection and 3D manipulation controls)\r\n\r\nCompatible versions of the above libraries are included in the `js`\r\nsubdirectory and retain their original authorship and licenses.\r\n\r\n## Current Status\r\n\r\nVoxView currently displays a single 1x1x1 cube with both wireframe and\r\nsolid translucent shading. The cube is embedded in a representation of\r\nthe voxel grid: Each corner of the cube mesh is at the center of a\r\nvoxel cell and the center vertex of the grid is at the center of the\r\nmesh.\r\n\r\nThe user interface allows panning, zooming, and rotating to view the\r\nmesh from various perspectives and also allows each corner of the mesh\r\ncube to be moved anywhere within its voxel cell. This is intended to\r\nreproduce the variety of mesh configurations that can be reproduced in\r\nSOE's Landmark voxel-based game engine.\r\n\r\n## Future Plans\r\n\r\n* Add geometry to emphasize important points in the data structure\r\n  (material values on vertices, mesh corners, etc.)\r\n\r\n* Client-based storage of interesting configurations\r\n\r\n* Permalinks to interesting configurations\r\n\r\n* Merging of manipulated voxel grids into larger grids with proper\r\n  corner precedence.\r\n  \r\n## Licensing\r\n\r\nThis software (unless otherwise noted) is distrbuted under the terms\r\nof the MIT License. See the LICENSE file for details.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
